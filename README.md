## About Website

The website contains a photo gallery, styled in a presentable manner using the float css property. Each photo and information about it obtained from the json file using ajax jQuery is converted into object so that it can later be used to modify elements in the html file. The website allows the user to filter or sort the images in the photo gallery.
